				<b>is anything that inhibits the clean flow of communication between users on NirvanaMC Network.</b><br />
				<b>Disruptive communication includes but is not limited to:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Flooding: Posting an excessive number of threads or posts is disruptive to communication. Don't do it.</li>
					<li>Non-English Communication: NirvanaMC Network is an English language service. Communication, particularly content viewable by many users, will be conducted in the English language. This also means that users will use the English language properly. "Leet speak" and alternating upper/lowercase letters (i.e. "tYpInG lIKe ThIS") are difficult to read and will not be tolerated.</li>
					<li>Off-Topic Posting: Posting content in a section it doesn't belong in (Example: Posting a thread about a 360 exclusive on the PS3 forum.) Replying to content with unrelated information.</li>
				    <li>Excessive quote towers: Quoting users to reply is okay. When it starts going into multiple quotes, however, it just expands the page longer than it needs to be and starts to look obtrusive. If you feel the need to quote multiple users, do so one at a time.</li>
					<li>Miscellaneous: Communication that disrupts the easy browsing of the site will not be tolerated. This includes exceedingly large pictures, large ASCII art, or links that go to a destination other than the one stated. (Example: Rick rolling)</li>
